	abstractNote = {International forest reporting processes and increasing forest disturbances delineate new requirements regarding the information delivered by national forest inventories (NFI), with implications on their sampling strategies. An original comparative review of the sampling designs of 6 pioneer NFI programs being both annual and 5-year periodic evidences a set of common principles used to meet these demands, but also marked implementation differences, and open questions. Bases for a common framework and persisting research needs are highlighted. Developing virtual forest sampling simulation facilities at large scale is a critical challenge. National forest inventories (NFI) rely on diverse sampling strategies. In view of international forest reporting processes, these surveys are increasingly adopting a 5-year periodicity (their bar). The increased need for delivering updated representative statistics in the context of the environmental crisis is making annual forest inventory (their beat) a growing standard of the forest monitoring approach. To meet both objectives, spatially balanced sampling designs resulting in samples that can be split into yearly systematic subsamples have been devised. They ground the grid-based interpenetrating panel design principle that has generated various ingenious designs, however never presented nor reviewed to date. The purpose of this review was to explore how the interpenetrating panel design principle has been implemented by the NFIs that have turned annual. The aims were to describe and frame the diversity of their designs, highlight their common bases and differences, and compare their ability to address new reporting needs. A special emphasis was placed on the graphical representation of these sampling designs. The NFI programs of France, Norway, Poland, Romania, Sweden, and of the USA were considered. The interpenetrating panel design principle is effective in reviewed inventories and is associated with the 5-year moving-window estimator. Original and creative design developments were identified, causing substantial variations in its implementation. They concern panel geometry, unaligned sampling options, sampling unit status, and estimation methods, making no-two inventory designs identical among those reviewed. In these inventories, the notions of annual and cyclic inventory do not substitute for each other, but appear to complement themselves to serve distinct reporting purposes. Also, negative coordination among annual samples is observed, questioning their adequacy for trend monitoring purposes. The review evidences that a core sampling design principle, used to simultaneously operate annual and 5-year periodic forest inventory, has given rise to a diversity of implementation options. While it offers an original benchmark for any survey transition toward an annual frequency, it demonstrates the absence of a standardized framework. Developing simulation facilities for the comparison and optimization of associated designs appears as a critical priority, especially in the context of the EC forest monitoring perspective.},

	DOI = {10.1111/jvs.13195},
	abstractNote = {Spatially balanced sampling is the most efficient method for surveying continuous and spatially structured populations. The spatial sampling of large-scale surveys is mostly based on grids whose properties drive and potentially limit the possibility of building flexible samples. Periodicity causes high sampling constraints when an increase in the frequency of information delivery is sought. The sampling stratification of the adaptive sampling intensity also conflicts with the grid-based approach. Although some surveys seemingly exploit these properties, no formal developments have been made available in the survey sampling literature across the fields of application. We define and demonstrate the geometric properties of square grids, demonstrate how they can be used to produce nested hierarchical grids compatible with multiple periodicity values of interest for natural monitoring, and adapt the sampling intensity across space and time. A simulation study was conducted to quantify how spatial balance can be traded slowly for sample size reduction. We showed that square grids have geometric properties that can be exploited to cope with spatial flexibility in the sampling effort and the spatiotemporal coordination of samples. We also provide an original extension of this framework intended to tune the sampling effort gradually while preserving spatial systematicity. The simulation study showed that a nested hierarchical grid can be used to progressively reduce the sampling intensity while preserving regularity in the spatial arrangement of units. We demonstrate the flexibility and diversity of sampling schemes that can be implemented with square grids, answering the need for periodicity and the coordination of multiple samples and the limits of their use. Square grids support advanced samplings with multiple periodicities (numbers from 1 to 5 here for a period of five years) and hierarchical nesting that result in a subsampling preserving spatial balance.},

Wood density was measured on 110,763 wood cores sampled at breast height over the period 2016--2019 on 20,697 NFI plots evenly distributed across mainland France. The dataset covers 156 European tree species and wide gradients of elevations (from 0 to 2,300 m above sea level), climates (oceanic, continental, mountain and Mediterranean climates) and soil conditions. It encompasses most European forest types, with the exception of boreal forests. The number of wood density measurements is roughly proportional to the abundance of tree species in the forest area sampled. This dataset's potential extends to the intensive documentation of a major ecological trait, the assessment of the drivers of wood density variation, or the improvement of forest biomass and carbon estimates, and their uncertainty.},

	DOI = {10.5194/egusphere-2025-4152},
	abstractNote = {Wood density is a key parameter for estimating forest biomass and carbon stocks. However, the magnitude and the drivers of wood density variation in temperate forests, and the implications of this variation for biomass and carbon assessments, are not well understood. This study provides a comprehensive analysis of wood density variation in trees of western temperate Europe and evaluates its impacts on forest aboveground biomass (AGB) estimates at multiple spatial scales. From an initial dataset comprising wood density measurements from 110,763 individual trees, representing 156 species across mainland France, we analysed a subset of 44 species accounting for 97 % of the growing stock and providing sufficient observations for modelling. We developed linear models of wood density based on tree, stand, site, and climatic variables, and successively examined the contributions of taxonomic identity, environmental factors and their interactions. We also constructed a model using variables potentially accessible through spatial layers (i.e., GIS-based data) at broad scales and fine resolutions, to assess their predictive capacity. Models were applied to French National Forest Inventory (NFI) data to estimate aboveground biomass (AGB) across four spatial scales: the national level, biogeographical regions and subregions (both delineated through biophysical partitioning of the territory) and individual NFI plots. Our analysis revealed that variation in wood density stemmed primarily from interspecific differences (78.5 % of the total variance), with the remaining 21.5 % attributable to intraspecific variability. Our best performing model—combining variables on species identity, tree dimensions, stand structure, site conditions and climate—explained 82 % of total wood density variation, though it captured only a modest portion of intraspecific variability, found mainly driven by tree dimensions and mean annual temperature. In contrast, the model relying solely on environmental factors and the one based on GIS-layer variables accounted for 14 % and 34 % of the variation, respectively. While accounting for wood density variation had minimal impact on national-scale AGB estimates, it caused deviations of up to 30 % at finer scales, such as biogeographical subregions and individual NFI plots. These findings highlight the importance of incorporating wood density variation into forest biomass and carbon assessment, especially at regional to local scales. Given its dominant role, we recommend integrating species identity as much as possible to enhance the accuracy of forest biomass and carbon stock assessment across spatial scales.},

Here, we present an exceptionally large dataset with section-wise stem measurements on 40'349 felled individual trees collected on plots of the Experimental Forest Management project. It is a revised and expanded version of previously unpublished data and contains the empirically derived coarse (diameter ≥7 cm) and fine branch volume of 27'297 and 18'980, respectively, individual trees. The data were collected between 1888 and 1974 across Switzerland covering a large topographic gradient and a diverse species range and can thus support estimations and verification of volume functions also outside Switzerland including the derivation of whole tree volume in a consistent manner.},

	abstractNote = {Woody tissue carbon (C) concentration is a key wood trait necessary for accurately estimating forest C stocks and fluxes, which also varies widely across species and biomes. However, coarse approximations of woody tissue C (e.g., 50%) remain commonplace in forest C estimation and reporting protocols, despite leading to substantial errors in forest C estimates. Here, we describe the Global Woody Tissue Carbon Concentration Database (GLOWCAD): a database containing 3,676 individual records of woody tissue C concentrations from 864 tree species. Woody tissue C concentration data—i.e., the mass of C per unit dry mass—were obtained from live and dead woody tissues from 130 peer-reviewed sources published between 1980--2020. Auxiliary data for each observation include tissue type, as well as decay class and size characteristics for dead wood. In GLOWCAD, 1,242 data points are associated with geographic coordinates, and are therefore presented alongside 46 standardized bioclimatic variables extracted from climate databases. GLOWCAD represents the largest available woody tissue C concentration database, and informs studies on forest C estimation, as well as analyses evaluating the extent, causes, and consequences of inter- and intraspecific variation in wood chemical traits.},

	DOI = {10.1016/j.foreco.2025.123112},
	abstractNote = {National Forest Inventories (NFIs) provide statistically reliable information on forest resources at national and other large spatial scales. As forest management and conservation needs become increasingly complex, NFIs are being called upon to provide forest parameter estimates at spatial scales smaller than current design-based estimation procedures can provide. This is particularly true when estimates are desired by species or species groups, which is often required to inform wildlife habitat management, sustainable forestry certifications, or timber product assessments. Here we propose a multivariate spatial model for small area estimation of species-specific forest inventory parameters. The hierarchical Bayesian modeling framework accounts for key complexities in species-specific forest inventory data, such as zero-inflation, correlations among species, and residual spatial autocorrelation. Importantly, by fitting the model directly to the individual plot-level data, the framework enables estimates of species-level forest parameters, with associated uncertainty, across any user-defined small area of interest. A simulation study revealed minimal bias and higher accuracy of the proposed model-based approach compared to the design-based estimator. We applied the model to estimate species-specific county-level aboveground biomass for the 20 most abundant tree species in the southern United States using Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) data. County-level biomass estimates from the proposed model had high correlations with design-based estimates, yet the model-based estimates tended to have a slight positive bias relative to design-based estimates, particularly for abundant and managed species. Importantly, the proposed model provided large gains in precision across all 20 species. On average across species, 91.5% of county-level biomass estimates had higher precision compared to the design-based estimates. Future work should explore incorporation of additional auxiliary data sources that can help explain fine-scale variation in biomass of managed species. The proposed framework is an attractive solution for NFI data users to generate species-level forest parameter estimates with reasonable precision at management-relevant spatial scales.},

	abstractNote = {NASA's Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) is collecting spaceborne full waveform lidar data with a primary science goal of producing accurate estimates of forest aboveground biomass density (AGBD). This paper presents the development of the models used to create GEDI's footprint-level (~25 m) AGBD (GEDI04_A) product, including a description of the datasets used and the procedure for final model selection. The data used to fit our models are from a compilation of globally distributed spatially and temporally coincident field and airborne lidar datasets, whereby we simulated GEDI-like waveforms from airborne lidar to build a calibration database. We used this database to expand the geographic extent of past waveform lidar studies, and divided the globe into four broad strata by Plant Functional Type (PFT) and six geographic regions. GEDI's waveform-to-biomass models take the form of parametric Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) models with simulated Relative Height (RH) metrics as predictor variables. From an exhaustive set of candidate models, we selected the best input predictor variables, and data transformations for each geographic stratum in the GEDI domain to produce a set of comprehensive predictive footprint-level models. We found that model selection frequently favored combinations of RH metrics at the 98th, 90th, 50th, and 10th height above ground-level percentiles (RH98, RH90, RH50, and RH10, respectively), but that inclusion of lower RH metrics (e.g. RH10) did not markedly improve model performance. Second, forced inclusion of RH98 in all models was important and did not degrade model performance, and the best performing models were parsimonious, typically having only 1-3 predictors. Third, stratification by geographic domain (PFT, geographic region) improved model performance in comparison to global models without stratification. Fourth, for the vast majority of strata, the best performing models were fit using square root transformation of field AGBD and/or height metrics. There was considerable variability in model performance across geographic strata, and areas with sparse training data and/or high AGBD values had the poorest performance. These models are used to produce global predictions of AGBD, but will be improved in the future as more and better training data become available.},

	abstractNote = {NASA's Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) mission one of the objectives is to estimate global forest aboveground biomass (AGB) using full waveform (WF) LiDAR data. GEDI's relative height (RH) metrics, derived from vertical energy distributions, serve as key predictors in AGB modeling, with energy quantiles ranging from 0 % to 100 %. Despite extensive studies on RH metrics, the selection of optimal RH metrics for AGB estimation remains inconsistent, and using fewer metrics can result in a loss of vertical structural complexity. This study explores the potential of dense sampling of RH metrics (RH5 to RH100, in 5 % increments) to retain forest structural complexity, even across diverse forest regimes. Using noise-free simulated GEDI WF data, we developed machine learning models (Cubist, Random Forest, and XGBoost) to estimate AGB across 174 forest plots in the Brazilian Amazon. Results showed that dense RH sampling outperformed models using fewer recommended RH metrics. Our proposed suite of mean RH (mRH) metrics (R2 = 0.71, RMSE = 65.88 Mg/ha, nRMSE = 0.36) -- derived at plot level from an extensive suite of RH metrics (RH5 to RH100, in 5 % increments) at sub-plot level, and vertical mean RH (vmRH) RH metrics within the 20 % waveform vertical energy distribution (vmRH20, vmRH40, vmRH60, vmRH80, and vmRH100) approach showed similar performance, at the plot level of an average size of 50 m by 50 m. The single vmRH metrics versus plot-level AGB estimates -- vmRH80 consistently gives the best results for all ML models and Ordinary Least Square (OLS) regression with R2 ranges from (0.65--0.68), RMSE (53.18 -- 70.51) Mg/ha -- highest RMSE reported for OLS regression. All model's performances were comparable giving similar RMSE, nRMSE, and coefficient of determination (R2) for derivative RH metrics -- mRH and vmRH -- compared with the traditional approach of selective RH metrics at GEDI footprint level estimates. The trained model provided AGB estimates at 30 m resolution for entire ALS survey areas of sites (n = 174) in the Brazilian Legal Amazon (BLA) region. Overall, this approach retains GEDI waveform information effectively and offers a scalable solution for regional and potentially global AGB modeling.},

Because the cumulative bole volume of each tree is measured to numerous upper-bole locations, correlations between measurements within a tree are likely.

	title = {Common tree definitions for national forest inventories in Europe},
	volume = {43},
	DOI = {10.14214/sf.463},
	abstractNote = {At the international level, various definitions have been established for the compilation and publication of forest resources assessment results over the last decade. These international definitions frequently rely on terms that are not precisely specified for inventory purposes and do not completely cover the requirements arising from the application of National Forest Inventory (NFI) data. Also, with respect to conventional topics such as forest area and growing stock estimation, several terms and expressions referring to individual trees are not, or are only vaguely, defined until now. Since the individual tree is the basic element of any forest resources assessment, the clarification of tree-related terms is an important part of COST Action E43 to harmonise common reporting of National Forest Inventories. Based on a review of existing definitions and on the requirements for harmonised reporting, common tree-related definitions are established. One objective of this study is to refine and enhance the applicability of available tree and shrub definitions, in particular with regard to the distinction between trees and shrubs. The study also focuses on the parts or âelementsâ of trees and on the distinction between these elements as they are of particular importance in growing stock and biomass definitions. Furthermore, several definitions for tree characteristics such as âlivingâ and âstandingâ, as well as tree variables such as height, length, diameter at breast height, and crown projection area are adjusted with respect to NFI purposes. A concluding discussion reflects upon the reviewed, refined and newly established definitions. The definitions presented in this paper provide a firm basis for a common set of harmonised reference definitions developed by COST Action E43 and contribute to the precise and consistent use of terms.},

	volume = {28},
	ISSN = {1354-1013},
	DOI = {10.1111/gcb.16038},
	abstractNote = {Robust ecological forecasting of tree growth under future climate conditions is critical to anticipate future forest carbon storage and flux. Here, we apply three ingredients of ecological forecasting that are key to improving forecast skill: data fusion, confronting model predictions with new data, and partitioning forecast uncertainty. Specifically, we present the first fusion of tree-ring and forest inventory data within a Bayesian state-space model at a multi-site, regional scale, focusing on Pinus ponderosa var. brachyptera in the southwestern US. Leveraging the complementarity of these two data sources, we parsed the ecological complexity of tree growth into the effects of climate, tree size, stand density, site quality, and their interactions, and quantified uncertainties associated with these effects. New measurements of trees, an ongoing process in forest inventories, were used to confront forecasts of tree diameter with observations, and evaluate alternative tree growth models. We forecasted tree diameter and increment in response to an ensemble of climate change projections, and separated forecast uncertainty into four different causes: initial conditions, parameters, climate drivers, and process error. We found a strong negative effect of fall--spring maximum temperature, and a positive effect of water-year precipitation on tree growth. Furthermore, tree vulnerability to climate stress increases with greater competition, with tree size, and at poor sites. Under future climate scenarios, we forecast increment declines of 22%--117%, while the combined effect of climate and size-related trends results in a 56%--91% decline. Partitioning of forecast uncertainty showed that diameter forecast uncertainty is primarily caused by parameter and initial conditions uncertainty, but increment forecast uncertainty is mostly caused by process error and climate driver uncertainty. This fusion of tree-ring and forest inventory data lays the foundation for robust ecological forecasting of aboveground biomass and carbon accounting at tree, plot, and regional scales, including iterative improvement of model skill. Great enthusiasm surrounds forest carbon sequestration as a way to offset carbon emissions and address the climate crisis, but ecological complexity contributes to scientific uncertainty about forest responses to climate change. Here, we fused together two important sources of information on tree growth -- forest inventory and tree-ring data -- to quantify multiple drivers of Pinus ponderosa tree growth (climate sensitivity, competition, tree size, and site quality), and their interactions. Ecological forecasting approaches indicate that growth will decline by 56%--91% under future climate conditions and allow us to identify the causes of uncertainty surrounding future tree growth.},

All application areas are concerned, from theoretical physics to engineering and socio-economics. This introductory paper provides the sensitivity analysis aims and objectives in order to explain the composition of the overall “Sensitivity Analysis” chapter of the Springer Handbook. It also describes the basic principles of sensitivity analysis, some classification grids to understand the application ranges of each method, a useful software package, and the notations used in the chapter papers. This section also offers a succinct description of sensitivity auditing, a new discipline that tests the entire inferential chain including model development, implicit assumptions, and normative issues and which is recommended when the inference provided by the model needs to feed into a regulatory or policy process. For the “Sensitivity Analysis” chapter, in addition to this introduction, eight papers have been written by around twenty practitioners from different fields of application. They cover the most widely used methods for this subject: the deterministic methods as the local sensitivity analysis, the experimental design strategies, the sampling-based and variance-based methods developed from the 1980s, and the new importance measures and metamodel-based techniques established and studied since the 2000s. In each paper, toy examples or industrial applications illustrate their relevance and usefulness.},

The software is able to process 3000 cores per hour semi-automatically. Manual intervention may be required to control and eventually adjust the positioning of the cores. The software was tested on 30 trees from 13 temperate species. Two increment cores were taken from each tree: one 5 mm diameter core and one 4 mm diameter core. The obtained CT density of the cores was compared to reference data obtained by volume and mass measurement on the 5 mm cores. The reference data were used for tuning the software settings by leave-one-out cross validation method. The obtained root mean square error was below 10 kg/m3 (1.7%) for the 5 mm cores. For the 4 mm cores, the root mean square difference with the reference density of the 5 mm cores was 25 kg/m3 (4.2%).},

	abstractNote = {Given the multiple abiotic and biotic stressors resulting from global changes, management systems and practices must be adapted in order to maintain and reinforce the resilience of forests. Among others, the transformation of monocultures into uneven-aged and mixed stands is an avenue to improve forest resilience. To explore the forest response to these new silvicultural practices under a changing environment, one needs models combining a process-based approach with a detailed spatial representation, which is quite rare. We therefore decided to develop our own model (HETEROFOR for HETEROgeneous FORest) according to a spatially explicit approach, describing individual tree growth based on resource sharing (light, water and nutrients). HETEROFOR was progressively elaborated within Capsis (Computer-Aided Projection for Strategies in Silviculture), a collaborative modelling platform devoted to tree growth and stand dynamics. This paper describes the carbon-related processes of HETEROFOR (photosynthesis, respiration, carbon allocation and tree dimensional growth) and evaluates the model performances for three broadleaved stands with different species compositions (Wallonia, Belgium). This first evaluation showed that HETEROFOR predicts well individual radial growth (Pearson's correlation of 0.83 and 0.63 for the European beech and sessile oak, respectively) and is able to reproduce size--growth relationships. We also noticed that the net to gross primary production (npp to gpp) ratio option for describing maintenance respiration provides better results than the temperature-dependent routine, while the process-based (Farquhar model) and empirical (radiation use efficiency) approaches perform similarly for photosynthesis. To illustrate how the model can be used to predict climate change impacts on forest ecosystems, we simulated the growth dynamics of the mixed stand driven by three IPCC climate scenarios. According to these simulations, the tree growth trends will be governed by the CO2 fertilization effect, with the increase in vegetation period length and the increase in water stress also playing a role but offsetting each other.},

Using data from 374,888 globally distributed trees, we explore how climate, disturbance, competition, functional traits, and evolutionary history constrain the height and crown width scaling relationships of 1914 tree species. We find that variation in height--diameter scaling relationships is primarily controlled by water availability and light competition. Conversely, crown width is predominantly shaped by exposure to wind and fire, while also covarying with functional traits related to mechanical stability and photosynthesis. Additionally, we identify several plant lineages with highly distinctive stem and crown forms, such as the exceedingly slender dipterocarps of Southeast Asia, or the extremely wide crowns of legume trees in African savannas. Our study charts the global spectrum of tree crown architecture and pinpoints the processes that shape the 3D structure of woody ecosystems.},

In addition, an independent dataset (dataset #2), constituted by 176 felled trees from 13 species, was collected for validating the models.From dataset #1, the RMSE for the prediction of the total volume varied from 0.005 to 0.476m3, depending on the diameter class, and the corresponding relative RMSE varied from 8.0% to 13.7%, depending on the diameter class.A 10-fold cross-validation on dataset #1 gave an average RMSE of 0.136 for the prediction of the VEF and of 0.150m3 for the prediction of the total volume, which was in the same order as average RMSE obtained from the whole dataset #1.Validation on dataset #2 gave satisfactory results, even for the application of VEF to other tree species: RMSE obtained for the different tree species were in the same order as RMSE obtained from calibration dataset #1, except for some particular cases. The largest errors were obtained when the model was clearly used in extrapolation, e.g., for five large-size Fraxinus (whereas dataset #1 included smaller trees) and several Quercus and Fagus from coppice-with-standards stands (whereas dataset #1 included mainly pure even-aged high-forest trees).The observed differences between species seemed consistent with the general knowledge about species-specific traits. For a given diameter at breast height, angiosperms were found to have a much larger volume of branches in comparison with the corresponding stem volume than gymnosperms. For a tree of 30cm in diameter, the lowest values of VEF were obtained for Picea and Abies (VEF<1.1) and the highest ones for Fraxinus and Carpinus (VEF>1.3).The methodology that was developed, based on nonlinear mixed-effects modeling, is easily applicable to other definitions of VEF or biomass expansion factors.},

This unique computational approach ensures that you understand enough of the details to make reasonable choices and interpretations in your own modeling work. The text presents causal inference and generalized linear multilevel models from a simple Bayesian perspective that builds on information theory and maximum entropy. The core material ranges from the basics of regression to advanced multilevel models. It also presents measurement error, missing data, and Gaussian process models for spatial and phylogenetic confounding. The second edition emphasizes the directed acyclic graph (DAG) approach to causal inference, integrating DAGs into many examples. The new edition also contains new material on the design of prior distributions, splines, ordered categorical predictors, social relations models, cross-validation, importance sampling, instrumental variables, and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. It ends with an entirely new chapter that goes beyond generalized linear modeling, showing how domain-specific scientific models can be built into statistical analyses.

	abstractNote = {A simple, novel, and general method is presented in this paper for approximating the sum of independent or arbitrarily correlated lognormal random variables (RV) by a single lognormal RV. The method is also shown to be applicable for approximating the sum of lognormal-Rice and Suzuki RVs by a single lognormal RV. A sum consisting of a mixture of the above distributions can also be easily handled. The method uses the moment generating function (MGF) as a tool in the approximation and does so without the extremely precise numerical computations at a large number of points that were required by the previously proposed methods in the literature. Unlike popular approximation methods such as the Fenton-Wilkinson method and the Schwartz-Yeh method, which have their own respective short-comings, the proposed method provides the parametric flexibility to accurately approximate different portions of the lognormal sum distribution. The accuracy of the method is measured both visually, as has been done in the literature, as well as quantitatively, using curve-fitting metrics. An upper bound on the sensitivity of the method is also provided.},

	abstractNote = {The uptake of carbon dioxide (CO2) by terrestrial ecosystems is critical for moderating climate change1. To provide a ground-based long-term assessment of the contribution of forests to terrestrial CO2 uptake, we synthesized in situ forest data from boreal, temperate and tropical biomes spanning three decades. We found that the carbon sink in global forests was steady, at 3.6 ± 0.4 Pg C yr-1 in the 1990s and 2000s, and 3.5 ± 0.4 Pg C yr-1 in the 2010s. Despite this global stability, our analysis revealed some major biome-level changes. Carbon sinks have increased in temperate (+30 ± 5%) and tropical regrowth (+29 ± 8%) forests owing to increases in forest area, but they decreased in boreal (-36 ± 6%) and tropical intact (-31 ± 7%) forests, as a result of intensified disturbances and losses in intact forest area, respectively. Mass-balance studies indicate that the global land carbon sink has increased2, implying an increase in the non-forest-land carbon sink. The global forest sink is equivalent to almost half of fossil-fuel emissions (7.8 ± 0.4 Pg C yr-1 in 1990--2019). However, two-thirds of the benefit from the sink has been negated by tropical deforestation (2.2 ± 0.5 Pg C yr-1 in 1990--2019). Although the global forest sink has endured undiminished for three decades, despite regional variations, it could be weakened by ageing forests, continuing deforestation and further intensification of disturbance regimes1. To protect the carbon sink, land management policies are needed to limit deforestation, promote forest restoration and improve timber-harvesting practices1,3. Data from boreal, temperate and tropical forests over the past three decades reveal that the global forest carbon sink has remained steady during that time, despite considerable regional variation.},

Statistical theory is given for construction of confidence and prediction intervals for the two procedures. Specific examples using slash pine (Pinus elliottii Engelm. var. elliottii) biomass data are presented to demonstrate and clarify the methods behind nonlinear estimation, additivity, error modeling, and the formation of confidence and prediction intervals. Theoretical considerations and empirical evidence indicate procedure 2 is generally superior to procedure 1. It is argued that modeling the error structure is preferable to using the logarithmic transformation to deal with the problem of heteroscedasticity. The techniques given are applicable to any quantity that can be disaggregated into logical components.},

	abstractNote = {Tree size shapes forest carbon dynamics and determines how trees interact with their environment, including a changing climate. Here, we conduct the first global analysis of among-site differences in how aboveground biomass stocks and fluxes are distributed with tree size. We analyzed repeat tree censuses from 25 large-scale (4--52 ha) forest plots spanning a broad climatic range over five continents to characterize how aboveground biomass, woody productivity, and woody mortality vary with tree diameter. We examined how the median, dispersion, and skewness of these size-related distributions vary with mean annual temperature and precipitation. In warmer forests, aboveground biomass, woody productivity, and woody mortality were more broadly distributed with respect to tree size. In warmer and wetter forests, aboveground biomass and woody productivity were more right skewed, with a long tail towards large trees. Small trees (1--10 cm diameter) contributed more to productivity and mortality than to biomass, highlighting the importance of including these trees in analyses of forest dynamics. Our findings provide an improved characterization of climate-driven forest differences in the size structure of aboveground biomass and dynamics of that biomass, as well as refined benchmarks for capturing climate influences in vegetation demographic models.

	abstractNote = {Volume prediction models are fundamental in forestry, as they support forest inventories, sustainable forest management strategies, and comprehensive environmental planning. The main objective of this study was to implement and compare two prominent approaches—regression and machine learning—for modeling whole-tree volume and stem volume in two Pinus species in community forests of southern Mexico. Destructive sampling provided data from 56 P. patula and 51 P. pseudostrobus trees, covering a wide range of diameters and heights. The regression approach employed seemingly unrelated nonlinear regression (NSUR) to fit simultaneous additive volume systems using both one- and two-variable models. In this approach, volume was modeled as a function of diameter at breast height (d) alone and as a function of both d and total tree height (h). Species and volume type were implicitly accounted for within the structure of the additive systems structure. For the machine learning approach, multilayer perceptron (MLP) artificial neural networks (ANNs) were trained using four input variables: diameter at breast height, total tree height, species, and volume type. These variables were explicitly incorporated into the ANN structure, enabling the model to learn complex, non-linear interactions. The ANN was optimized using L1 regularization and the Adam optimizer. The quantitative variables were diameter at breast height and total tree height, while the qualitative variables were species (P. patula and P. pseudostrobus) and volume type (whole-tree volume and stem volume), both coded as 1 and 0, respectively. The relative rank method was used to identify the most effective models based on goodness-of-fit statistics, including the coefficient of determination (R2), average absolute error (AAE), total relative error (TRE), average systematic error (ASE), and mean percent standard error (MPSE). The ANN approach consistently outperformed the regression model, achieving higher R2 values and lower error metrics across all evaluations. Specifically, the ANN model reduced AAE, TRE, and ASE while maintaining biologically consistent predictions. This proposed ANN model represents a significant advancement in modeling both whole-tree and stem volume simultaneously and independently across different species, providing reliable and precise estimates. Given its ability to handle complex, non-linear relationships and its superior accuracy, we recommend the use of ANN as a practical tool in forestry applications, including forest resource evaluation and the development of sustainable forest management plans.},

Here we lay out fast and stable computations for LOO and WAIC that can be performed using existing simulation draws. We introduce an efficient computation of LOO using Pareto-smoothed importance sampling (PSIS), a new procedure for regularizing importance weights. Although WAIC is asymptotically equal to LOO, we demonstrate that PSIS-LOO is more robust in the finite case with weak priors or influential observations. As a byproduct of our calculations, we also obtain approximate standard errors for estimated predictive errors and for comparison of predictive errors between two models. We implement the computations in an R package called loo and demonstrate using models fit with the Bayesian inference package Stan.},

	abstractNote = {Allometric scaling laws critically examine structure-function relationships. In estimating the forest biomass carbon and its response under climate change, the issue of scaling has resulted in difficulties when modelling the biomass for different-sized trees, especially large ones, and has not yet been solved in either theory or practice. Here, we propose the concept of a dynamic allometric scaling relationship between stem biomass and above-ground biomass The allometric curve approaches an asymptote with an increase in tree size. An asymptotic allometric equation is presented that has a better fit to the data than the simple power-law allometric equation. The non-constant exponent is determined by the change in the biomass ratio for different organs and is governed by the dynamic allometric coefficient. This study presents a methodological framework to theoretically characterize allometric relationships and provides new insights in understanding the general scaling pattern and carbon sequestration capacity of large trees across global forests. Projecting biomass carbon in forests is challenging due to the modelling of different-sized trees. This Article proposes a dynamic allometric scaling relationship that better fits scaling patterns for large trees and their biomass.},

The volume equations were, in general, based on more representative data covering larger geographical regions. The volume equations were available for major tree species in Europe.
