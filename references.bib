	abstractNote = {Tree species differ from one another in, and display trade-offs among, a wide range of attributes, including canopy and understorey growth and mortality rates, fecundity, height and crown allometry, and crown transmissivity. But how does this variation affect the outcome of interspecific competition and hence community structure? We derive criteria for the outcome of competition among tree species competing for light, given their allometric and life-history parameters. These criteria are defined in terms of a new simple whole life-cycle measure of performance, which provides a simple way to organize and understand the many ways in which species differ. The general case, in which all parameters can differ between species, can produce coexistence, founder control or competitive exclusion: thus, competition for light need not be hierarchical as implied by R theory. The special case in which species differ only in crown transmissivity produces neutral dynamics. The special case in which species differ in all parameters except crown transmissivity gives hierarchical competition, where the equivalent of R is , the height at which trees enter the canopy in an equilibrium monoculture.},

	abstractNote = {Species distribution modelling is an easy, persuasive and useful tool for anticipating species distribution shifts under global change. Numerous studies have used only climate variables to predict future potential species range shifts and have omitted environmental factors important for determining species distribution. Here, we assessed the importance of the edaphic dimension in the niche-space definition of Quercus pubescens and in future spatial projections under global change over the metropolitan French forest territory. We fitted two species distribution models (SDM) based on presence/absence data (111 013 plots), one calibrated from climate variables only (mean temperature of January and climatic water balance of July) and the other one from both climate and edaphic (soil pH inferred from plants) variables. Future predictions were conducted under two climate scenarios (PCM B2 and HadCM3 A2) and based on 100 simulations using a cellular automaton that accounted for seed dispersal distance, landscape barriers preventing migration and unsuitable land cover. Adding the edaphic dimension to the climate-only SDM substantially improved the niche-space definition of Q. pubescens, highlighting an increase in species tolerance in confronting climate constraints as the soil pH increased. Future predictions over the 21st century showed that disregarding the edaphic dimension in SDM led to an overestimation of the potential distribution area, an underestimation of the spatial fragmentation of this area, and prevented the identification of local refugia, leading to an underestimation of the northward shift capacity of Q. pubescens and its persistence in its current distribution area. Spatial discrepancies between climate-only and climate-plus-edaphic models are strengthened when seed dispersal and forest fragmentation are accounted for in predicting a future species distribution area. These discrepancies highlight some imprecision in spatial predictions of potential distribution area of species under climate change scenarios and possibly wrong conclusions for conservation and management perspectives when climate-only models are used.},

	abstractNote = {International forest reporting processes and increasing forest disturbances delineate new requirements regarding the information delivered by national forest inventories (NFI), with implications on their sampling strategies. An original comparative review of the sampling designs of 6 pioneer NFI programs being both annual and 5-year periodic evidences a set of common principles used to meet these demands, but also marked implementation differences, and open questions. Bases for a common framework and persisting research needs are highlighted. Developing virtual forest sampling simulation facilities at large scale is a critical challenge. National forest inventories (NFI) rely on diverse sampling strategies. In view of international forest reporting processes, these surveys are increasingly adopting a 5-year periodicity (their bar). The increased need for delivering updated representative statistics in the context of the environmental crisis is making annual forest inventory (their beat) a growing standard of the forest monitoring approach. To meet both objectives, spatially balanced sampling designs resulting in samples that can be split into yearly systematic subsamples have been devised. They ground the grid-based interpenetrating panel design principle that has generated various ingenious designs, however never presented nor reviewed to date. The purpose of this review was to explore how the interpenetrating panel design principle has been implemented by the NFIs that have turned annual. The aims were to describe and frame the diversity of their designs, highlight their common bases and differences, and compare their ability to address new reporting needs. A special emphasis was placed on the graphical representation of these sampling designs. The NFI programs of France, Norway, Poland, Romania, Sweden, and of the USA were considered. The interpenetrating panel design principle is effective in reviewed inventories and is associated with the 5-year moving-window estimator. Original and creative design developments were identified, causing substantial variations in its implementation. They concern panel geometry, unaligned sampling options, sampling unit status, and estimation methods, making no-two inventory designs identical among those reviewed. In these inventories, the notions of annual and cyclic inventory do not substitute for each other, but appear to complement themselves to serve distinct reporting purposes. Also, negative coordination among annual samples is observed, questioning their adequacy for trend monitoring purposes. The review evidences that a core sampling design principle, used to simultaneously operate annual and 5-year periodic forest inventory, has given rise to a diversity of implementation options. While it offers an original benchmark for any survey transition toward an annual frequency, it demonstrates the absence of a standardized framework. Developing simulation facilities for the comparison and optimization of associated designs appears as a critical priority, especially in the context of the EC forest monitoring perspective.},

	DOI = {10.1111/jvs.13195},
	abstractNote = {Spatially balanced sampling is the most efficient method for surveying continuous and spatially structured populations. The spatial sampling of large-scale surveys is mostly based on grids whose properties drive and potentially limit the possibility of building flexible samples. Periodicity causes high sampling constraints when an increase in the frequency of information delivery is sought. The sampling stratification of the adaptive sampling intensity also conflicts with the grid-based approach. Although some surveys seemingly exploit these properties, no formal developments have been made available in the survey sampling literature across the fields of application. We define and demonstrate the geometric properties of square grids, demonstrate how they can be used to produce nested hierarchical grids compatible with multiple periodicity values of interest for natural monitoring, and adapt the sampling intensity across space and time. A simulation study was conducted to quantify how spatial balance can be traded slowly for sample size reduction. We showed that square grids have geometric properties that can be exploited to cope with spatial flexibility in the sampling effort and the spatiotemporal coordination of samples. We also provide an original extension of this framework intended to tune the sampling effort gradually while preserving spatial systematicity. The simulation study showed that a nested hierarchical grid can be used to progressively reduce the sampling intensity while preserving regularity in the spatial arrangement of units. We demonstrate the flexibility and diversity of sampling schemes that can be implemented with square grids, answering the need for periodicity and the coordination of multiple samples and the limits of their use. Square grids support advanced samplings with multiple periodicities (numbers from 1 to 5 here for a period of five years) and hierarchical nesting that result in a subsampling preserving spatial balance.},

Wood density was measured on 110,763 wood cores sampled at breast height over the period 2016--2019 on 20,697 NFI plots evenly distributed across mainland France. The dataset covers 156 European tree species and wide gradients of elevations (from 0 to 2,300 m above sea level), climates (oceanic, continental, mountain and Mediterranean climates) and soil conditions. It encompasses most European forest types, with the exception of boreal forests. The number of wood density measurements is roughly proportional to the abundance of tree species in the forest area sampled.

	DOI = {10.5194/egusphere-2025-4152},
	abstractNote = {Wood density is a key parameter for estimating forest biomass and carbon stocks. However, the magnitude and the drivers of wood density variation in temperate forests, and the implications of this variation for biomass and carbon assessments, are not well understood. This study provides a comprehensive analysis of wood density variation in trees of western temperate Europe and evaluates its impacts on forest aboveground biomass (AGB) estimates at multiple spatial scales. From an initial dataset comprising wood density measurements from 110,763 individual trees, representing 156 species across mainland France, we analysed a subset of 44 species accounting for 97 % of the growing stock and providing sufficient observations for modelling. We developed linear models of wood density based on tree, stand, site, and climatic variables, and successively examined the contributions of taxonomic identity, environmental factors and their interactions. We also constructed a model using variables potentially accessible through spatial layers (i.e., GIS-based data) at broad scales and fine resolutions, to assess their predictive capacity. Models were applied to French National Forest Inventory (NFI) data to estimate aboveground biomass (AGB) across four spatial scales: the national level, biogeographical regions and subregions (both delineated through biophysical partitioning of the territory) and individual NFI plots. Our analysis revealed that variation in wood density stemmed primarily from interspecific differences (78.5 % of the total variance), with the remaining 21.5 % attributable to intraspecific variability. Our best performing model—combining variables on species identity, tree dimensions, stand structure, site conditions and climate—explained 82 % of total wood density variation, though it captured only a modest portion of intraspecific variability, found mainly driven by tree dimensions and mean annual temperature. In contrast, the model relying solely on environmental factors and the one based on GIS-layer variables accounted for 14 % and 34 % of the variation, respectively. While accounting for wood density variation had minimal impact on national-scale AGB estimates, it caused deviations of up to 30 % at finer scales, such as biogeographical subregions and individual NFI plots. These findings highlight the importance of incorporating wood density variation into forest biomass and carbon assessment, especially at regional to local scales. Given its dominant role, we recommend integrating species identity as much as possible to enhance the accuracy of forest biomass and carbon stock assessment across spatial scales.},

Woody tissue C concentration data—i.e., the mass of C per unit dry mass—were obtained from live and dead woody tissues from 130 peer-reviewed sources published between 1980--2020. Auxiliary data for each observation include tissue type, as well as decay class and size characteristics for dead wood. In GLOWCAD, 1,242 data points are associated with geographic coordinates, and are therefore presented alongside 46 standardized bioclimatic variables extracted from climate databases.

	abstractNote = {National Forest Inventories (NFIs) provide statistically reliable information on forest resources at national and other large spatial scales. As forest management and conservation needs become increasingly complex, NFIs are being called upon to provide forest parameter estimates at spatial scales smaller than current design-based estimation procedures can provide. This is particularly true when estimates are desired by species or species groups, which is often required to inform wildlife habitat management, sustainable forestry certifications, or timber product assessments. Here we propose a multivariate spatial model for small area estimation of species-specific forest inventory parameters. The hierarchical Bayesian modeling framework accounts for key complexities in species-specific forest inventory data, such as zero-inflation, correlations among species, and residual spatial autocorrelation. Importantly, by fitting the model directly to the individual plot-level data, the framework enables estimates of species-level forest parameters, with associated uncertainty, across any user-defined small area of interest. A simulation study revealed minimal bias and higher accuracy of the proposed model-based approach compared to the design-based estimator. We applied the model to estimate species-specific county-level aboveground biomass for the 20 most abundant tree species in the southern United States using Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) data. County-level biomass estimates from the proposed model had high correlations with design-based estimates, yet the model-based estimates tended to have a slight positive bias relative to design-based estimates, particularly for abundant and managed species. Importantly, the proposed model provided large gains in precision across all 20 species. On average across species, 91.5% of county-level biomass estimates had higher precision compared to the design-based estimates. Future work should explore incorporation of additional auxiliary data sources that can help explain fine-scale variation in biomass of managed species. The proposed framework is an attractive solution for NFI data users to generate species-level forest parameter estimates with reasonable precision at management-relevant spatial scales.},

This paper presents the development of the models used to create GEDI's footprint-level (~25 m) AGBD (GEDI04_A) product, including a description of the datasets used and the procedure for final model selection. The data used to fit our models are from a compilation of globally distributed spatially and temporally coincident field and airborne lidar datasets, whereby we simulated GEDI-like waveforms from airborne lidar to build a calibration database. We used this database to expand the geographic extent of past waveform lidar studies, and divided the globe into four broad strata by Plant Functional Type (PFT) and six geographic regions. GEDI's waveform-to-biomass models take the form of parametric Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) models with simulated Relative Height (RH) metrics as predictor variables. From an exhaustive set of candidate models, we selected the best input predictor variables, and data transformations for each geographic stratum in the GEDI domain to produce a set of comprehensive predictive footprint-level models. We found that model selection frequently favored combinations of RH metrics at the 98th, 90th, 50th, and 10th height above ground-level percentiles (RH98, RH90, RH50, and RH10, respectively), but that inclusion of lower RH metrics (e.g. RH10) did not markedly improve model performance. Second, forced inclusion of RH98 in all models was important and did not degrade model performance, and the best performing models were parsimonious, typically having only 1-3 predictors. Third, stratification by geographic domain (PFT, geographic region) improved model performance in comparison to global models without stratification. Fourth, for the vast majority of strata, the best performing models were fit using square root transformation of field AGBD and/or height metrics. There was considerable variability in model performance across geographic strata, and areas with sparse training data and/or high AGBD values had the poorest performance. These models are used to produce global predictions of AGBD, but will be improved in the future as more and better training data become available.},

	abstractNote = {NASA's Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) mission one of the objectives is to estimate global forest aboveground biomass (AGB) using full waveform (WF) LiDAR data. GEDI's relative height (RH) metrics, derived from vertical energy distributions, serve as key predictors in AGB modeling, with energy quantiles ranging from 0 % to 100 %. Despite extensive studies on RH metrics, the selection of optimal RH metrics for AGB estimation remains inconsistent, and using fewer metrics can result in a loss of vertical structural complexity. This study explores the potential of dense sampling of RH metrics (RH5 to RH100, in 5 % increments) to retain forest structural complexity, even across diverse forest regimes. Using noise-free simulated GEDI WF data, we developed machine learning models (Cubist, Random Forest, and XGBoost) to estimate AGB across 174 forest plots in the Brazilian Amazon. Results showed that dense RH sampling outperformed models using fewer recommended RH metrics. Our proposed suite of mean RH (mRH) metrics (R2 = 0.71, RMSE = 65.88 Mg/ha, nRMSE = 0.36) -- derived at plot level from an extensive suite of RH metrics (RH5 to RH100, in 5 % increments) at sub-plot level, and vertical mean RH (vmRH) RH metrics within the 20 % waveform vertical energy distribution (vmRH20, vmRH40, vmRH60, vmRH80, and vmRH100) approach showed similar performance, at the plot level of an average size of 50 m by 50 m. The single vmRH metrics versus plot-level AGB estimates -- vmRH80 consistently gives the best results for all ML models and Ordinary Least Square (OLS) regression with R2 ranges from (0.65--0.68), RMSE (53.18 -- 70.51) Mg/ha -- highest RMSE reported for OLS regression. All model's performances were comparable giving similar RMSE, nRMSE, and coefficient of determination (R2) for derivative RH metrics -- mRH and vmRH -- compared with the traditional approach of selective RH metrics at GEDI footprint level estimates. The trained model provided AGB estimates at 30 m resolution for entire ALS survey areas of sites (n = 174) in the Brazilian Legal Amazon (BLA) region. Overall, this approach retains GEDI waveform information effectively and offers a scalable solution for regional and potentially global AGB modeling.},

Because the cumulative bole volume of each tree is measured to numerous upper-bole locations, correlations between measurements within a tree are likely.

	DOI = {10.14214/sf.463},
	abstractNote = {At the international level, various definitions have been established for the compilation and publication of forest resources assessment results over the last decade. These international definitions frequently rely on terms that are not precisely specified for inventory purposes and do not completely cover the requirements arising from the application of National Forest Inventory (NFI) data. Also, with respect to conventional topics such as forest area and growing stock estimation, several terms and expressions referring to individual trees are not, or are only vaguely, defined until now. Since the individual tree is the basic element of any forest resources assessment, the clarification of tree-related terms is an important part of COST Action E43 to harmonise common reporting of National Forest Inventories. Based on a review of existing definitions and on the requirements for harmonised reporting, common tree-related definitions are established. One objective of this study is to refine and enhance the applicability of available tree and shrub definitions, in particular with regard to the distinction between trees and shrubs. The study also focuses on the parts or âelementsâ of trees and on the distinction between these elements as they are of particular importance in growing stock and biomass definitions. Furthermore, several definitions for tree characteristics such as âlivingâ and âstandingâ, as well as tree variables such as height, length, diameter at breast height, and crown projection area are adjusted with respect to NFI purposes. A concluding discussion reflects upon the reviewed, refined and newly established definitions. The definitions presented in this paper provide a firm basis for a common set of harmonised reference definitions developed by COST Action E43 and contribute to the precise and consistent use of terms.},

	abstractNote = {Linking local population dynamics and species distributions is crucial to predicting the impacts of climate change. Although many studies focus on the mean fitness of populations, theory shows that species distributions can be shaped by demographic stochasticity or population resilience. Here, we examine how mean fitness (measured by invasion rate), demographic stochasticity and resilience (measured by the ability to recover from disturbance) constrain populations at the edges compared with the climatic centre. Europe: Spain, France, Germany, Finland and Sweden. Forest inventory data used for fitting the models cover the period from 1985 to 2013. Dominant European tree species; angiosperms and gymnosperms. We developed dynamic population models covering the entire life cycle of 25 European tree species with climatically dependent recruitment models fitted to forest inventory data. We then ran simulations using integral projection and individual-based models to test how invasion rates, risk of stochastic extinction and ability to recover from stochastic disturbances differ between the centre and edges of the climatic niches of species. Results varied among species, but in general, demographic constraints were stronger at warm edges and for species in harsher climates. Conversely, recovery was more limiting at cold edges. In addition, we found that for several species, constraints at the edges were attributable to demographic stochasticity and capacity for recovery rather than mean fitness. Our results highlight that mean fitness is not the only mechanism at play at the edges; demographic stochasticity and population capacity to recover also matter for European tree species. To understand how climate change will drive species range shifts, future studies will need to analyse the interplay between population mean growth rate and stochastic demographic processes in addition to disturbances.},

	DOI = {10.1111/ecog.06042},
	abstractNote = {Recent climate warming has fueled interest into climate-driven range shifts of tree species. A common approach to detect range shifts is to compare the divergent occurrences between juvenile and adult trees along environmental gradients using static data. Divergent occurrences between life stages can, however, also be caused by ontogenetic effects. These include shifts of the viable environmental conditions throughout development (‘ontogenetic niche shift') as well as demographic dependencies that constrain the possible occurrence of subsequent life stages. Whether ontogenetic effects are an important driver of divergent occurrences between juvenile and adult trees along large-scale climatic gradients is largely unknown. It is, however, critical in evaluating whether impacts of environmental change can be inferred from static data on life stage occurrences. Here, we first show theoretically, using a two-life stage simulation model, how both temporal range shift and ontogenetic effects can lead to similar divergent occurrences between adults and juveniles (juvenile divergence). We further demonstrate that juvenile divergence can unambiguously be attributed to ontogenetic effects, when juveniles diverge from adults in opposite direction to their temporal shift along the environmental gradient. Second, to empirically test whether ontogenetic effects are an important driver of divergent occurrences across Europe, we use repeated national forest inventories from Sweden, Germany and Spain to assess juvenile divergence and temporal shift for 40 tree species along large-scale climatic gradients. About half of the species-country combinations had significant juvenile divergences along heat sum and water availability gradients. Only a quarter of the tree species had significant detectable temporal shifts within the observation period. Furthermore, significant juvenile divergences were frequently associated with opposite temporal shifts, indicating that ontogenetic effects are a relevant cause of divergent occurrences between life stages. Our study furthers the understanding of ontogenetic effects and challenges the practice of inferring climate change impacts from static data.},

	DOI = {10.1111/gcb.16038},
	abstractNote = {Robust ecological forecasting of tree growth under future climate conditions is critical to anticipate future forest carbon storage and flux. Here, we apply three ingredients of ecological forecasting that are key to improving forecast skill: data fusion, confronting model predictions with new data, and partitioning forecast uncertainty. Specifically, we present the first fusion of tree-ring and forest inventory data within a Bayesian state-space model at a multi-site, regional scale, focusing on Pinus ponderosa var. brachyptera in the southwestern US. Leveraging the complementarity of these two data sources, we parsed the ecological complexity of tree growth into the effects of climate, tree size, stand density, site quality, and their interactions, and quantified uncertainties associated with these effects. New measurements of trees, an ongoing process in forest inventories, were used to confront forecasts of tree diameter with observations, and evaluate alternative tree growth models. We forecasted tree diameter and increment in response to an ensemble of climate change projections, and separated forecast uncertainty into four different causes: initial conditions, parameters, climate drivers, and process error. We found a strong negative effect of fall--spring maximum temperature, and a positive effect of water-year precipitation on tree growth. Furthermore, tree vulnerability to climate stress increases with greater competition, with tree size, and at poor sites. Under future climate scenarios, we forecast increment declines of 22%--117%, while the combined effect of climate and size-related trends results in a 56%--91% decline. Partitioning of forecast uncertainty showed that diameter forecast uncertainty is primarily caused by parameter and initial conditions uncertainty, but increment forecast uncertainty is mostly caused by process error and climate driver uncertainty. This fusion of tree-ring and forest inventory data lays the foundation for robust ecological forecasting of aboveground biomass and carbon accounting at tree, plot, and regional scales, including iterative improvement of model skill. Great enthusiasm surrounds forest carbon sequestration as a way to offset carbon emissions and address the climate crisis, but ecological complexity contributes to scientific uncertainty about forest responses to climate change. Here, we fused together two important sources of information on tree growth -- forest inventory and tree-ring data -- to quantify multiple drivers of Pinus ponderosa tree growth (climate sensitivity, competition, tree size, and site quality), and their interactions. Ecological forecasting approaches indicate that growth will decline by 56%--91% under future climate conditions and allow us to identify the causes of uncertainty surrounding future tree growth.},

It also describes the basic principles of sensitivity analysis, some classification grids to understand the application ranges of each method, a useful software package, and the notations used in the chapter papers. This section also offers a succinct description of sensitivity auditing, a new discipline that tests the entire inferential chain including model development, implicit assumptions, and normative issues and which is recommended when the inference provided by the model needs to feed into a regulatory or policy process. For the “Sensitivity Analysis” chapter, in addition to this introduction, eight papers have been written by around twenty practitioners from different fields of application. They cover the most widely used methods for this subject: the deterministic methods as the local sensitivity analysis, the experimental design strategies, the sampling-based and variance-based methods developed from the 1980s, and the new importance measures and metamodel-based techniques established and studied since the 2000s. In each paper, toy examples or industrial applications illustrate their relevance and usefulness.},

The obtained CT density of the cores was compared to reference data obtained by volume and mass measurement on the 5 mm cores. The reference data were used for tuning the software settings by leave-one-out cross validation method. The obtained root mean square error was below 10 kg/m3 (1.7%) for the 5 mm cores.

	volume = {13},
	DOI = {10.5194/gmd-13-905-2020},
	abstractNote = {Given the multiple abiotic and biotic stressors resulting from global changes, management systems and practices must be adapted in order to maintain and reinforce the resilience of forests. Among others, the transformation of monocultures into uneven-aged and mixed stands is an avenue to improve forest resilience. To explore the forest response to these new silvicultural practices under a changing environment, one needs models combining a process-based approach with a detailed spatial representation, which is quite rare. We therefore decided to develop our own model (HETEROFOR for HETEROgeneous FORest) according to a spatially explicit approach, describing individual tree growth based on resource sharing (light, water and nutrients). HETEROFOR was progressively elaborated within Capsis (Computer-Aided Projection for Strategies in Silviculture), a collaborative modelling platform devoted to tree growth and stand dynamics. This paper describes the carbon-related processes of HETEROFOR (photosynthesis, respiration, carbon allocation and tree dimensional growth) and evaluates the model performances for three broadleaved stands with different species compositions (Wallonia, Belgium). This first evaluation showed that HETEROFOR predicts well individual radial growth (Pearson's correlation of 0.83 and 0.63 for the European beech and sessile oak, respectively) and is able to reproduce size--growth relationships. We also noticed that the net to gross primary production (npp to gpp) ratio option for describing maintenance respiration provides better results than the temperature-dependent routine, while the process-based (Farquhar model) and empirical (radiation use efficiency) approaches perform similarly for photosynthesis. To illustrate how the model can be used to predict climate change impacts on forest ecosystems, we simulated the growth dynamics of the mixed stand driven by three IPCC climate scenarios. According to these simulations, the tree growth trends will be governed by the CO2 fertilization effect, with the increase in vegetation period length and the increase in water stress also playing a role but offsetting each other.},

	abstractNote = {Trees can differ enormously in their crown architectural traits, such as the scaling relationships between tree height, crown width and stem diameter. Yet despite the importance of crown architecture in shaping the structure and function of terrestrial ecosystems, we lack a complete picture of what drives this incredible diversity in crown shapes. Using data from 374,888 globally distributed trees, we explore how climate, disturbance, competition, functional traits, and evolutionary history constrain the height and crown width scaling relationships of 1914 tree species. We find that variation in height--diameter scaling relationships is primarily controlled by water availability and light competition. Conversely, crown width is predominantly shaped by exposure to wind and fire, while also covarying with functional traits related to mechanical stability and photosynthesis. Additionally, we identify several plant lineages with highly distinctive stem and crown forms, such as the exceedingly slender dipterocarps of Southeast Asia, or the extremely wide crowns of legume trees in African savannas. Our study charts the global spectrum of tree crown architecture and pinpoints the processes that shape the 3D structure of woody ecosystems.},

	DOI = {10.1111/1365-2745.13533},
	abstractNote = {Species range limits are thought to result from a decline in demographic performance at range edges. However, recent studies reporting contradictory patterns in species demographic performance at their edges cast doubt on our ability to predict climate change demographic impacts. To understand these inconsistent demographic responses, we need to shift the focus from geographic to climatic edges and analyse how species responses vary with climatic constraints at the edge and species' ecological strategy. Here we parameterised integral projection models with climate and competition effects for 27 tree species using forest inventory data from over 90,000 plots across Europe. Our models estimate size-dependent climatic responses and evaluate their effects on two life trajectory metrics: life span and passage time—the time to grow to a large size. Then we predicted growth, survival, life span and passage time at the hot and dry or cold and wet edges and compared them to their values at the species climatic centre to derive indices of demographic response at the edge. Using these indices, we investigated whether differences in species demographic response between hot and cold edges could be explained by their position along the climate gradient and functional traits related to their climate stress tolerance. We found that at cold and wet edges of European tree species, growth and passage time were constrained, whereas at their hot and dry edges, survival and life span were constrained. Demographic constraints at the edge were stronger for species occurring in extreme conditions, that is, in hot edges of hot-distributed species and cold edges of cold-distributed species. Species leaf nitrogen content was strongly linked to their demographic responses at the edge. In contrast, we found only weak links with wood density, leaf size and xylem vulnerability to embolism. Synthesis. Our study presents a more complicated picture than previously thought with demographic responses that differ between hot and cold edges. Predictions of climate change impacts should be refined to include edge and species characteristics. Using integral projection models parametrized with forest inventory data from across Europe, we tested whether demographic performance declines at range edges in 27 tree species. We found that at cold and wet edges growth and passage time were constrained, whereas at hot and dry edges, survival and lifespan were constrained.},

	DOI = {10.1111/ecog.02788},
	abstractNote = {The role of modern climatic microrefugia is a neglected aspect in the study of biotic responses to anthropogenic climate change. Current projections of species redistribution at continental extent are based on climatic grids of coarse (≥ 1 km) resolutions that fail to capture spatiotemporal dynamics associated with climatic microrefugia. Here, we review recent methods to model the climatic component of potential microrefugia and highlight research gaps in accounting for the buffering capacity due to biophysical processes operating at very fine (< 1 m) resolutions (e.g. canopy cover) and the associated microclimatic stability over time (i.e. decoupling). To overcome this challenge, we propose a spatially hierarchical downscaling framework combining a free-air temperature grid at 1 km resolution, a digital elevation model at 25 m resolution and small-footprint light detection-and-ranging (LiDAR) data at 50 cm resolution with knowledge from the literature to mechanistically model sub-canopy temperatures and account for microclimatic decoupling. We applied this framework on a virtual sub-canopy species and simulated the impact of a warming scenario on its potential distribution. Modelling sub-canopy temperatures at 50 cm resolution and accounting for microclimatic stability over time enlarges the range of temperature conditions towards the cold end of the gradient, mitigates regional temperature changes and decreases extirpation risks. Incorporating these spatiotemporal dynamics into species redistribution models, being correlative, mechanistic or hybrid, will increase the probability of local persistence, which has important consequences in the understanding of the capacity of species to adapt. We finally provide a synthesis on additional ways that the field could move towards effectively considering potential climatic microrefugia for species redistribution.},

	DOI = {10.1111/geb.13209},
	abstractNote = {Dynamic range models are proposed to investigate species distributions and to project range shifts under climate change. They are based upon the Hutchinsonian niche theory, specifying that the occurrence of a species in an environmental space should be limited to positions where the intrinsic growth rate is positive. Evaluating population growth rate is, however, difficult for physiologically structured populations, such as forest stands, owing to size-induced individual variation in performance. Therefore, we still have a limited understanding of which aspect of tree demography contributes the most to their geographical range limit. We develop an index of demographic performance for size-structured populations and study its variation across a climatic gradient. We then investigate the relationship between the demographic performance index and species distribution. North America (57--124° W, 26--52° N). 1963--2010. Fourteen tree species. We represent forest dynamics with a size-structured population model and neighbourhood competition with the perfect plasticity approximation. We then derive the lifetime reproduction per individual, , in the absence of density dependence. Using forest inventory data, we assess how tree demography for each species varies with climate. We test the model by comparing and the probability of occurrence within species ranges. We find that both growth and mortality rates vary across species distributions, but climate explains little of the observed variation. Individual size and neighbourhood competition are the primary explanatory variables of tree demography. Finally, we find that relates weakly to the probability of occurrence, with no systematic decline in population growth rates towards the range limits. Spatial and size-induced variation in tree growth and mortality do not explain range limits and are insufficient to enable an understanding of tree dynamics. We propose that phenomena perceived mostly at the metapopulation scale should also be considered.},

In addition, an independent dataset (dataset #2), constituted by 176 felled trees from 13 species, was collected for validating the models.From dataset #1, the RMSE for the prediction of the total volume varied from 0.005 to 0.476m3, depending on the diameter class, and the corresponding relative RMSE varied from 8.0% to 13.7%, depending on the diameter class.A 10-fold cross-validation on dataset #1 gave an average RMSE of 0.136 for the prediction of the VEF and of 0.150m3 for the prediction of the total volume, which was in the same order as average RMSE obtained from the whole dataset #1.Validation on dataset #2 gave satisfactory results, even for the application of VEF to other tree species: RMSE obtained for the different tree species were in the same order as RMSE obtained from calibration dataset #1, except for some particular cases. The largest errors were obtained when the model was clearly used in extrapolation, e.g., for five large-size Fraxinus (whereas dataset #1 included smaller trees) and several Quercus and Fagus from coppice-with-standards stands (whereas dataset #1 included mainly pure even-aged high-forest trees).The observed differences between species seemed consistent with the general knowledge about species-specific traits. For a given diameter at breast height, angiosperms were found to have a much larger volume of branches in comparison with the corresponding stem volume than gymnosperms. For a tree of 30cm in diameter, the lowest values of VEF were obtained for Picea and Abies (VEF<1.1) and the highest ones for Fraxinus and Carpinus (VEF>1.3).The methodology that was developed, based on nonlinear mixed-effects modeling, is easily applicable to other definitions of VEF or biomass expansion factors.},

	abstractNote = {Aim The study and prediction of species--environment relationships is currently mainly based on species distribution models. These purely correlative models neglect spatial population dynamics and assume that species distributions are in equilibrium with their environment. This causes biased estimates of species niches and handicaps forecasts of range dynamics under environmental change. Here we aim to develop an approach that statistically estimates process-based models of range dynamics from data on species distributions and permits a more comprehensive quantification of forecast uncertainties. Innovation We present an approach for the statistical estimation of process-based dynamic range models (DRMs) that integrate Hutchinson's niche concept with spatial population dynamics. In a hierarchical Bayesian framework the environmental response of demographic rates, local population dynamics and dispersal are estimated conditional upon each other while accounting for various sources of uncertainty. The method thus: (1) jointly infers species niches and spatiotemporal population dynamics from occurrence and abundance data, and (2) provides fully probabilistic forecasts of future range dynamics under environmental change. In a simulation study, we investigate the performance of DRMs for a variety of scenarios that differ in both ecological dynamics and the data used for model estimation. Main conclusions Our results demonstrate the importance of considering dynamic aspects in the collection and analysis of biodiversity data. In combination with informative data, the presented framework has the potential to markedly improve the quantification of ecological niches, the process-based understanding of range dynamics and the forecasting of species responses to environmental change. It thereby strengthens links between biogeography, population biology and theoretical and applied ecology.},

	abstractNote = {The uptake of carbon dioxide (CO2) by terrestrial ecosystems is critical for moderating climate change1. To provide a ground-based long-term assessment of the contribution of forests to terrestrial CO2 uptake, we synthesized in situ forest data from boreal, temperate and tropical biomes spanning three decades. We found that the carbon sink in global forests was steady, at 3.6 ± 0.4 Pg C yr-1 in the 1990s and 2000s, and 3.5 ± 0.4 Pg C yr-1 in the 2010s. Despite this global stability, our analysis revealed some major biome-level changes. Carbon sinks have increased in temperate (+30 ± 5%) and tropical regrowth (+29 ± 8%) forests owing to increases in forest area, but they decreased in boreal (-36 ± 6%) and tropical intact (-31 ± 7%) forests, as a result of intensified disturbances and losses in intact forest area, respectively. Mass-balance studies indicate that the global land carbon sink has increased2, implying an increase in the non-forest-land carbon sink. The global forest sink is equivalent to almost half of fossil-fuel emissions (7.8 ± 0.4 Pg C yr-1 in 1990--2019). However, two-thirds of the benefit from the sink has been negated by tropical deforestation (2.2 ± 0.5 Pg C yr-1 in 1990--2019). Although the global forest sink has endured undiminished for three decades, despite regional variations, it could be weakened by ageing forests, continuing deforestation and further intensification of disturbance regimes1. To protect the carbon sink, land management policies are needed to limit deforestation, promote forest restoration and improve timber-harvesting practices1,3. Data from boreal, temperate and tropical forests over the past three decades reveal that the global forest carbon sink has remained steady during that time, despite considerable regional variation.},

Procedure 1 is a simple combination approach, and procedure 2 is based on nonlinear joint-generalized regression (nonlinear seemingly unrelated regressions) with parameter restrictions. Statistical theory is given for construction of confidence and prediction intervals for the two procedures. Specific examples using slash pine (Pinus elliottii Engelm. var. elliottii) biomass data are presented to demonstrate and clarify the methods behind nonlinear estimation, additivity, error modeling, and the formation of confidence and prediction intervals. Theoretical considerations and empirical evidence indicate procedure 2 is generally superior to procedure 1. It is argued that modeling the error structure is preferable to using the logarithmic transformation to deal with the problem of heteroscedasticity. The techniques given are applicable to any quantity that can be disaggregated into logical components.},

However, based on a review of the literature it seems to be no consensus on which variable (predicted or observed) should be placed in each axis. Although some researchers think that it is identical, probably because r2 is the same for both regressions, the intercept and the slope of each regression differ and, in turn, may change the result of the model evaluation. We present mathematical evidence showing that the regression of predicted (in the y-axis) vs. observed data (in the x-axis) (PO) to evaluate models is incorrect and should lead to an erroneous estimate of the slope and intercept. In other words, a spurious effect is added to the regression parameters when regressing PO values and comparing them against the 1:1 line. Observed (in the y-axis) vs. predicted (in the x-axis) (OP) regressions should be used instead. We also show in an example from the literature that both approaches produce significantly different results that may change the conclusions of the model evaluation.},

Here, we conduct the first global analysis of among-site differences in how aboveground biomass stocks and fluxes are distributed with tree size. We analyzed repeat tree censuses from 25 large-scale (4--52 ha) forest plots spanning a broad climatic range over five continents to characterize how aboveground biomass, woody productivity, and woody mortality vary with tree diameter. We examined how the median, dispersion, and skewness of these size-related distributions vary with mean annual temperature and precipitation. In warmer forests, aboveground biomass, woody productivity, and woody mortality were more broadly distributed with respect to tree size. In warmer and wetter forests, aboveground biomass and woody productivity were more right skewed, with a long tail towards large trees. Small trees (1--10 cm diameter) contributed more to productivity and mortality than to biomass, highlighting the importance of including these trees in analyses of forest dynamics. Our findings provide an improved characterization of climate-driven forest differences in the size structure of aboveground biomass and dynamics of that biomass, as well as refined benchmarks for capturing climate influences in vegetation demographic models.

	abstractNote = {How temperate forests will respond to climate change is uncertain; projections range from severe decline to increased growth. We conducted field tests of sessile oak (Quercus petraea), a widespread keystone European forest tree species, including more than 150 000 trees sourced from 116 geographically diverse populations. The tests were planted on 23 field sites in six European countries, in order to expose them to a wide range of climates, including sites reflecting future warmer and drier climates. By assessing tree height and survival, our objectives were twofold: (i) to identify the source of differential population responses to climate (genetic differentiation due to past divergent climatic selection vs. plastic responses to ongoing climate change) and (ii) to explore which climatic variables (temperature or precipitation) trigger the population responses. Tree growth and survival were modeled for contemporary climate and then projected using data from four regional climate models for years 2071--2100, using two greenhouse gas concentration trajectory scenarios each. Overall, results indicated a moderate response of tree height and survival to climate variation, with changes in dryness (either annual or during the growing season) explaining the major part of the response. While, on average, populations exhibited local adaptation, there was significant clinal population differentiation for height growth with winter temperature at the site of origin. The most moderate climate model (HIRHAM5-EC; rcp4.5) predicted minor decreases in height and survival, while the most extreme model (CCLM4-GEM2-ES; rcp8.5) predicted large decreases in survival and growth for southern and southeastern edge populations (Hungary and Turkey). Other nonmarginal populations with continental climates were predicted to be severely and negatively affected (Bercé, France), while populations at the contemporary northern limit (colder and humid maritime regions; Denmark and Norway) will probably not show large changes in growth and survival in response to climate change. We conducted field experiments where more than 150 000 trees from 116 geographically diverse populations of sessile oak were planted on 23 field sites in six European countries. Population responses for tree growth and survival were modeled for contemporary climate and then projected using data from four regional climate models for years 2071--2100. Overall, results indicated a moderate response of sessile oak to climate variation, with changes in dryness explaining a predominant part of the response. Stronger and more negative future responses are expected for southeastern populations (Turkey, Hungary) than for central and northern populations (Denmark, Norway).},

	abstractNote = {Volume prediction models are fundamental in forestry, as they support forest inventories, sustainable forest management strategies, and comprehensive environmental planning. The main objective of this study was to implement and compare two prominent approaches—regression and machine learning—for modeling whole-tree volume and stem volume in two Pinus species in community forests of southern Mexico. Destructive sampling provided data from 56 P. patula and 51 P. pseudostrobus trees, covering a wide range of diameters and heights. The regression approach employed seemingly unrelated nonlinear regression (NSUR) to fit simultaneous additive volume systems using both one- and two-variable models. In this approach, volume was modeled as a function of diameter at breast height (d) alone and as a function of both d and total tree height (h). Species and volume type were implicitly accounted for within the structure of the additive systems structure. For the machine learning approach, multilayer perceptron (MLP) artificial neural networks (ANNs) were trained using four input variables: diameter at breast height, total tree height, species, and volume type. These variables were explicitly incorporated into the ANN structure, enabling the model to learn complex, non-linear interactions. The ANN was optimized using L1 regularization and the Adam optimizer. The quantitative variables were diameter at breast height and total tree height, while the qualitative variables were species (P. patula and P. pseudostrobus) and volume type (whole-tree volume and stem volume), both coded as 1 and 0, respectively. The relative rank method was used to identify the most effective models based on goodness-of-fit statistics, including the coefficient of determination (R2), average absolute error (AAE), total relative error (TRE), average systematic error (ASE), and mean percent standard error (MPSE). The ANN approach consistently outperformed the regression model, achieving higher R2 values and lower error metrics across all evaluations. Specifically, the ANN model reduced AAE, TRE, and ASE while maintaining biologically consistent predictions. This proposed ANN model represents a significant advancement in modeling both whole-tree and stem volume simultaneously and independently across different species, providing reliable and precise estimates. Given its ability to handle complex, non-linear relationships and its superior accuracy, we recommend the use of ANN as a practical tool in forestry applications, including forest resource evaluation and the development of sustainable forest management plans.},

	abstractNote = {Range dynamics causes mismatches between a species' geographical distribution and the set of suitable environments in which population growth is positive (the Hutchinsonian niche). This is because source--sink population dynamics cause species to occupy unsuitable environments, and because environmental change creates non-equilibrium situations in which species may be absent from suitable environments (due to migration limitation) or present in unsuitable environments that were previously suitable (due to time-delayed extinction). Because correlative species distribution models do not account for these processes, they are likely to produce biased niche estimates and biased forecasts of future range dynamics. Recently developed dynamic range models (DRMs) overcome this problem: they statistically estimate both range dynamics and the underlying environmental response of demographic rates from species distribution data. This process-based statistical approach qualitatively advances biogeographical analyses. Yet, the application of DRMs to a broad range of species and study systems requires substantial research efforts in statistical modelling, empirical data collection and ecological theory. Here we review current and potential contributions of these fields to a demographic understanding of niches and range dynamics. Our review serves to formulate a demographic research agenda that entails: (1) advances in incorporating process-based models of demographic responses and range dynamics into a statistical framework, (2) systematic collection of data on temporal changes in distribution and abundance and on the response of demographic rates to environmental variation, and (3) improved theoretical understanding of the scaling of demographic rates and the dynamics of spatially coupled populations. This demographic research agenda is challenging but necessary for improved comprehension and quantification of niches and range dynamics. It also forms the basis for understanding how niches and range dynamics are shaped by evolutionary dynamics and biotic interactions. Ultimately, the demographic research agenda should lead to deeper integration of biogeography with empirical and theoretical ecology.},

	abstractNote = {A climate warming of 2--5°C by the end of the century will impact the likelihood of seed germination of sugar maple (Acer saccharum), a dominant tree species which possesses a restricted temperature range to ensure successful reproduction. We hypothesize that seed origin affects germination due to the species' local adaptation to temperature. We tested this by experimentally investigating the effect of incubation temperature and temperature shifting on sugar maple seed germination from seven different seed sources representing the current species range. Survival analysis showed that seeds from the northern range had the highest germination percentage, while the southern range had the lowest. The mean germination percentage under constant temperatures was best when temperatures were ≤5°C, whereas germination percentages plummeted at temperatures ≥11°C (5.8%). Cool shifting increased germination by 19.1% over constant temperature treatments and by 29.3% over warm shifting treatments. Both shifting treatments caused earlier germination relative to the constant temperature treatments. A climate warming of up to +5°C is shown to severely reduce germination of seeds from the southern range. However, under a more pronounced warming of 7°C, seed germination at the northern range become more affected and now comparable to those found from the southern range. This study states that the high seed germination percentage found in sugar maple at the northern range makes it fairly resilient to the warmest projected temperature increase for the next century. These findings provide forest managers with the necessary information to make accurate projections when considering strategies for future regeneration while also considering climate warming.},

In Italy, phytomass models had never been constructed at the national level before. For any single tree, specific equations allow estimations of the following tree components to be made: stem and large branches (for either volume or phytomass), small branches (phytomass), stump (phytomass) and the whole tree phytomass. The models have been constructed on the basis of nearly 1,300 sampling units (sample trees). Although these equations must be considered intermediate results of the ongoing research because only half the scheduled number of samples has been collected, they have already been used in the practice, for example in the estimates reported in the recently published second national forest inventory.},

For species with slow demography and limited dispersal, such as trees, lags between climate change and distribution shifts are likely to increase in the future. Such lags can be of critical importance to management and biodiversity of forests, because they can result in ‘extinction debts’, where populations temporarily persist under unsuitable conditions, and ‘colonization credits’, where suitable locations are not occupied owing to slow demography and limited dispersal. Here we use a range dynamics model based on metapopulation theory to show that the distributions of 21 dominant trees in eastern North America are out of equilibrium with climate and demonstrate both extinction debt and colonization credit. Moreover, lags are more severe at northern range limits, suggesting that range contraction in response to warming temperatures will outpace expansion. Trees are likely to show lagged responses to climate change because they are sessile and long-lived. Here, the authors show that dominant tree species in North America are out of equilibrium with climate, with range contraction outpacing expansion.},

	abstractNote = {This paper uses theory and experiments to explore the effects of diversity on stability, productivity, and susceptibility to invasion. A model of resource competition predicts that increases in diversity cause community stability to increase, but population stability to decrease. These opposite effects are, to a great extent, explained by how temporal variances in species abundances scale with mean abundance, and by the differential impact of this scaling on population vs. community stability. Community stability also depends on a negative covariance effect (competitive compensation) and on overyielding (ecosystem productivity increasing with diversity). A long-term study in Minnesota grasslands supports these predictions. Models of competition predict, and field experiments confirm, that greater plant diversity leads to greater primary productivity. This diversity--productivity relationship results both from the greater chance that a more productive species would be present at higher diversity (the sampling effect) and from the better “coverage” of habitat heterogeneity caused by the broader range of species traits in a more diverse community (the niche differentiation effect). Both effects cause more complete utilization of limiting resources at higher diversity, which increases resource retention, further increasing productivity. Finally, lower levels of available limiting resources at higher diversity are predicted to decrease the susceptibility of an ecosystem to invasion, supporting the diversity--invasibility hypothesis. This mechanism provides rules for community assembly and invasion resistance. In total, biodiversity should be added to species composition, disturbance, nutrient supply, and climate as a major controller of population and ecosystem dynamics and structure. By their increasingly great directional impacts on all of these controllers, humans are likely to cause major long-term changes in the functioning of ecosystems worldwide. A better understanding of these ecosystem changes is needed if ecologists are to provide society with the knowledge essential for wise management of the earth and its biological resources.},

Although WAIC is asymptotically equal to LOO, we demonstrate that PSIS-LOO is more robust in the finite case with weak priors or influential observations. As a byproduct of our calculations, we also obtain approximate standard errors for estimated predictive errors and for comparison of predictive errors between two models.

	volume = {7},
	DOI = {10.1038/s41477-020-00815-8},
	abstractNote = {Allometric scaling laws critically examine structure-function relationships. In estimating the forest biomass carbon and its response under climate change, the issue of scaling has resulted in difficulties when modelling the biomass for different-sized trees, especially large ones, and has not yet been solved in either theory or practice. Here, we propose the concept of a dynamic allometric scaling relationship between stem biomass and above-ground biomass The allometric curve approaches an asymptote with an increase in tree size. An asymptotic allometric equation is presented that has a better fit to the data than the simple power-law allometric equation. The non-constant exponent is determined by the change in the biomass ratio for different organs and is governed by the dynamic allometric coefficient. This study presents a methodological framework to theoretically characterize allometric relationships and provides new insights in understanding the general scaling pattern and carbon sequestration capacity of large trees across global forests. Projecting biomass carbon in forests is challenging due to the modelling of different-sized trees. This Article proposes a dynamic allometric scaling relationship that better fits scaling patterns for large trees and their biomass.},

	ISSN = {1457-7356},
	DOI = {10.14214/sf.sfm4},
	abstractNote = {A review of stem volume and biomass equations for tree species growing in Europe is presented. The mathematical forms of the empirical models, the associated statistical parameters and information about the size of the trees and the country of origin were collated from scientific articles and from technical reports. The total number of the compiled equations for biomass estimation was 607 and for stem volume prediction it was 230. The analysis indicated that most of the biomass equations were developed for aboveground tree components. A relatively small number of equations were developed for southern Europe. Most of the biomass equations were based on a few sampled sites with a very limited number of sampled trees. The volume equations were, in general, based on more representative data covering larger geographical regions. The volume equations were available for major tree species in Europe. The collected information provides a basic tool for estimation of carbon stocks and nutrient balance of forest ecosystems across Europe as well as for validation of theoretical models of biomass allocation.},
