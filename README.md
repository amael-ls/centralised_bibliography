# Centralised bibliography

This git repo contains my bibliography file that is used by all my projects written in `latex` or `quarto` (from 2025).

> [!WARNING]  
> Once an entry is provided, the citing key should never change as it could break some documents!

> [!NOTE]  
> To use this centralised bib file, it is best to create a [git submodule](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules)
